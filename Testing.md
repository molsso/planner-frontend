The testing for this project is done manually. The expected results are the following: 

When I press “Create an Account,” there should be three text boxes: Full name, Username, and Password. Each text box should allow me to type something in. If I type something in a text box, delete it, and move to the next box, the box in which I just deleted something should have a red border, letting me know I need to type something there. 

When I press the “Signup” button, if all three text boxes are filled in, it should create an account for me and log me into the site, displaying any previous cards created in addition to my name (“Hello [name]”) near the “Logout” button. If all the text boxes are blank or one isn’t filled in, it should prompt me to fill in the text box and not create an account.

When I press “Login to an Account,” it should direct me away from the Sign up page and back to the login page.

When I press the “Add Card” button, a text box should appear for me to type something in and it should let me type something in. The “add” and “cancel” buttons should appear as well and be clickable.

When I press the “add” button, the card should appear in the respective category I added the card along with what I typed in it saved. So, if I add a card in any of the three columns, it should appear. Additionally, the date and time created, “Invalid date” for “Updated at,” and the author’s name should be there. For the author’s name, the name the user inputted when creating the account should appear, not his or her username. Furthermore, the “Edit” and “Delete” buttons should be present.

When I press the “Cancel” button, the card should disappear.

When I press the “Edit” button, the card should become a text box, allowing me to type something in. The “Save” and “Cancel” buttons should also appear.

When I press the “Save” button, the changed text should show as well as the time and date I edited the card. The time and date for “Created” and the name for “Author” should not change. The “Edit” and “Delete” buttons should still be present.

When I press the “Cancel” button, it should exit out of the text box. The text, time and date for “Created,” and the name for “Author” should stay the same. Also, the “Updated at” should still say “Invalid date.” If there was a previous edit--meaning, the “Updated at” already has a date and time--and I’m canceling a subsequent edit, the date and time should remain unchanged.

When I press the “Delete” button, the card should disappear.

When I click on a box, it should allow me to drag and drop it to any of the three columns.

When I press “Logout,” it should log me out of the planner. The login page, complete with text boxes to enter in your username and password, the blue “Log in” button, and the “Create an Account,” should appear. 

When I type in my username and password and press “Log in,” all of my cards as well as everyone else’s should be saved and appear with the same information in them. In other words, the “Created,” “Updated at,” and “Author” fields should not suddenly change or disappear. Text in the cards themselves should not change or disappear either. Also, when I log in with my credentials, the site should show my name at the top (“Hello [name]”) next to the Logout button, not someone else’s.
